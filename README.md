# Anagrams
Android application made as part of the Applied Computer Science with Android Course

This is a simple implementation of the anagrams game, with the user being allowed to add anagrams of the current word which contains one or two more letters, but does not contain the current word as an substring.

The extension implemented is the feature allowing addition of two letters.
